2. User login (with an email address and password)
3. Display a list of products (show product image, product name, price and quantity)
4. A â€˜add to cart button next to each product
5. View shopping cart (show the product, quantity and price with a Total value of all the products selected)
6. Checkout button (send an email to the logged-in users' email address with all the products they have purchased with an order number)
7. Store user information in a database as well as the products purchased for each user against an order number.

The front end project depends on the middleware (listing of products, etc). There's a class under (eTournamentAPI/eTournament/Helpers/TournamentAPI.cs) called
